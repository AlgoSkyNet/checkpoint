Package: RRT
Title: R Reproducibility Toolkit.
Description: The goal of RRT is to solve the problem of package reproducibility
    in R. Specifically, RRT allows you to install packages as they existed on
    CRAN at a specific snapshot date, as if you had a CRAN time machine.  To
    achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the packages
    to a local library exactly as they were at the specified point in time.
    Only those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any
    package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this
    way, anyone using RRT's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of
    your scripts or projects at any time.
