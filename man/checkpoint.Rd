\title{Configures R session to use packages as they existed on CRAN at a snapshot date.}
\usage{
checkpoint(snapshotDate, project = getwd(), verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{snapshotDate}{Date of snapshot to use in \code{YYYY-MM-DD} format,e.g. \code{"2014-09-17"}.  Daily snapshots exists on the MRAN server starting from \code{"2014-09-17"}.}

\item{project}{A project path. This is the path to the root of the project you want checkpointed. Defaults to current working directory using \code{\link{getwd()}}.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, displays progress messages.}
}
\value{
NULL. See the \code{details} section for side effects.
}
\description{
Together, the RRT package and the MRAN server act as a CRAN time machine. The \code{checkpoint()} function downloads the packages to a local library exactly as they were at the specified point in time. Only those packages are available to your session, thereby avoiding any package updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using RRT's \code{checkpoint()} can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any time.
}
\section{Details}{


As a consequence of running checkpoint, a specialized library will be set up that contains only packages as they were available on CRAN on the snapshot date; a session will only be able to install packages into or load them from said library. As an additional convenience, a heuristic is applied to find packages that are used in the project directory and install them in the snapshot specific library. Currently loaded packages are reloaded from the snapshot specific library.

Specifically, the function will:

\itemize{
\item{Create a new local snapshot library to download packages. This library folder is at \code{~/.rrt}}
\item{Update the options for your CRAN mirror and point to an MRAN snapshot using \code{options(repos)}}
\item{Scan your project folder for all required packages and install them from the snapshot using \code{\link[utils]{download.packages}}}
\item{Create a new profile to initialize your library path to the snapshot library path using \code{.Rprofile}}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

# Create temporary project and set working directory

example_project <- paste0("~/rrt_example_project_", Sys.Date())

dir.create(example_project, recursive = TRUE)
oldwd <- setwd(example_project)


# Write dummy code file to project

cat("library(MASS)", "library(foreach)",
    sep="\\n", 
    file="rrt_example_code.R")


# Create a checkpoint by specifying a snapshot date

library(RRT)
checkpoint("2014-09-17")

# Check that CRAN mirror is set to MRAN snapshot
getOption("repos")

# Check that library path is set to ~/.rrt
.libPaths()

# Check which packages are installed in RRT library
installed.packages()

# cleanup
unlink(example_project, recursive = TRUE)
setwd(oldwd)

}
