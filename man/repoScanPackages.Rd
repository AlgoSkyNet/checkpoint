\description{
Detect all packages used in repository. Parses all .R, .Rmd, .Rnw, .Rpres, and other files in the repository directory to determine what packages the repo depends directly.
}
\details{
Only direct dependencies are detected (i.e. no recursion).

Packages are determined by parsing repository source code and looking for calls to \code{library}, \code{require}, \code{::}, and \code{:::}.
